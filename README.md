I’ve loved coding since 5th grade of middle school (2009!), when I built my first games at school and made my teacher proud. Though I later studied civil engineering, the pandemic brought me back to what I truly love — coding — and I’ve been all in ever since.

## 🚀 My Projects
🎛️ Soundscapes UI – mix ambient sounds for focus & creativity  
📚 PhraseLoop – language learning app with smart repetition  
🎨 Creativity Jar – daily creative prompts to spark your imagination

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
React · TypeScript · JavaScript · HTML · CSS · Figma · Git · Node.js

## 💡 A Bit More About Me
· I love giving creative projects cozy, minimalistic UI vibes ✨ 
· I once coded a quiz game themed around my favorite artists 🎵 
· I collect weird product ideas just for fun 🧠 
· My playlists are sorted by mood, not genre 🎧 
· Debugging is better with tea 🍵 
· I’ve lived in over 10 places around the world 🌍 
· Frontend engineer by day, singer/songwriter by night 🎤 

## ⚡ Fun fact: 
I graduated high school with honors — but arrived late to the ceremony because I was gluing on my nails. Still nailed the speech.
