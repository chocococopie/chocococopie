I’ve loved coding since 5th grade of middle school (2009!), when I built my first games at school and made my teacher proud. Though I later studied civil engineering, the pandemic brought me back to what I truly love — coding — and I’ve been all in ever since.

## 🚀 My Projects
🎛️ Soundscapes UI – mix ambient sounds for focus & creativity  
📚 PhraseLoop – language learning app with smart repetition  
🎨 Creativity Jar – daily creative prompts to spark your imagination

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
React · TypeScript · JavaScript · HTML · CSS · Figma · Git · Node.js

## ⚡ Fun fact: 
I graduated high school with honors (one of only 3 that year!) — but showed up late to the ceremony because I was gluing on my nails. Still, I improvised a speech so bombastic it made the whole school tear up. No regrets.
