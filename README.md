# About Me

## Hi, I’m Diana 👋  
*Frontend Developer · UI Explorer · Sound-Mixing App Creator*  
Tea drinker. Pixel perfectionist. Debugger whisperer.

I wrote my first lines of code in 5th grade, building silly games during computer class while the rest of the school played Minesweeper. My teacher was so impressed, she showed it to everyone. I was hooked.

Later, I studied civil engineering (because life zigzags), but when the pandemic hit, I found myself back where I belonged — in the world of code, pixels, and logic puzzles. Since then, I’ve been deep-diving into frontend development, building creative tools, cozy interfaces, and ambient web experiences.

## 🛠️ What I Build

I’m passionate about creating *human-friendly* UIs — minimal, intuitive, and sometimes even fun. Whether it’s a focus-boosting sound app or a language-learning tool, I design with the user’s state of mind in mind.

**Projects I’ve built so far:**

- 🎛️ **Soundscapes UI** – mix ambient sounds for creativity & calm  
- 📚 **PhraseLoop** – smart language repetition that sticks  
- 🎨 **Creativity Jar** – daily prompts for curious minds  

_Check them out in my [Projects section](#)_

## 👩‍💻 What I Use

React · TypeScript · JavaScript · HTML · CSS · Figma · Git · Node.js  
(Also: a million sticky notes and, occasionally, brute force.)

## 🎤 After Hours

When I’m not coding, I’m probably:

- Writing lyrics that make no sense (until they suddenly do)  
- Sorting playlists by oddly specific moods like *“rainy logic errors”*  
- Dreaming up strange app ideas just for fun (current favorite: “Excuse me, are you a tree?”)

## ⚡ Fun fact: 
I graduated high school with honors — but arrived late to the ceremony because I was gluing on my nails. Still nailed the speech.

## 🌍 A Few Final Facts

- I've lived in over 10 places around the world  
- I debug best with a mug of tea in hand  
- I believe UI should feel like a good conversation: simple, clear, a little surprising
